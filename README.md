#The objective of this churn modeling project is to predict customer churn for a given dataset using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Accurately predicting churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers, thereby reducing loss and improving revenue.

The main objectives of this project are:

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors contributing to customer churn.

To build and train a predictive model for churn prediction.

To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using various metrics.

To optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning.

To interpret the results in business terms to inform decision-making.
